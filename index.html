            hi, hello. if you need to contact me, i have the contacts somewhere
            in the header or just scroll down to the very bottom of this site if
            i ever get to finish it. its also a way for me to practice some of
            my html, css, and javascript. the last one being the one i think i
            might focus on more because of its weirdness from what i've heard.
            maybe it's not that weird but might as well try it in some shape or
            form here on my site.
          </p>
          <p>
            as for my works or stuff that i have made, i made them out of fun.
            if i see something that i think would work with the idea i have, i
            make the video in the best way possible. some of my older stuff are
            not that great in my opinion. mostly because i have more stuff that
            i consider in my works than what i did in my older videos. I used
            and still use DaVinci Resolve for all of them. i also use Reaper for
            some music and lots of vsts for more complex audio but if its on
            videos, i use DaVinci Resolve instead. i like doing stuff on
            Blender. nothing too serious, just fun renders and animations. for
            my art, usually i make them on microsoft paint to doodle stuff. if i
            like the doodle enough and feel like it should be completed, i try
            and make a rough approximation of it in GIMP. it usually takes like
            2 months. sometimes months or years beacause the process goes from:
          </p>

          <h3 class="center italicize slide-from-right-anim-short">
            "oh i like this"
          </h3>
          <p class="center">to</p>
          <h3 class="center italicize slide-from-right-anim-short">
            "oh, this looks bad, go back"
          </h3>
          <p>
            both of them happening whenever i start the process or end the
            process. sometimes you just gotta go with your guts, sometimes you
            don't.

              a couple of stuff i've made for fun. sometimes from boredom. these
              are the top 3 that i was glad i worked on. if there are more than
              3, then it means that i was happy with the others. have a look at
              them if you want to. or not. your choice. do whatever you want. i
              might add more stuff to this like art and stuff.
